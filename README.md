# Plant Disease Detection

## üìå Introduction
Plant disease detection is crucial for ensuring healthy crop growth and preventing agricultural losses. This project utilizes **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** techniques, particularly **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, to detect plant diseases using **RGB images**. The approach aims to classify plants as either **healthy** or **diseased** based on image analysis.

## üöÄ Methodology
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Collect a diverse dataset of **RGB images** (healthy and diseased plants).
- Apply **data augmentation** (rotation, flipping, cropping) to improve variability.
- Normalize pixel values to ensure consistency.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Selection & Architecture
- **CNN Model**:
  - Extracts spatial features from images.
  - Uses convolutional layers for feature extraction and pooling layers for dimensionality reduction.
  - Fully connected layers classify images into **healthy** or **diseased**.
- **RNN Model**:
  - Designed for sequential data processing.
  - Utilizes **LSTM/GRU** units to capture temporal dependencies.
  - Enhances disease progression prediction over time.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training & Optimization
- Data split: **70% training, 15% validation, 15% testing**.
- Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size, dropout) to optimize performance.
- Loss and accuracy monitoring during training.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Integration & Deployment
- Combine CNN and RNN outputs for **comprehensive disease detection**.
- Develop an **API or interface** for real-time plant health predictions.
- Validate model performance in real-world agricultural settings.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring & Maintenance
- Continuously update the model with **new plant disease data**.
- Address deployment issues for **stable and robust operation**.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation & Reporting
- Evaluate performance using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.
- Document methodology, findings, and recommendations for further improvements.

## üìä Model Comparison
| Feature | CNN | RNN |
|---------|-----|-----|
| **Data Type** | Static images | Sequential image sequences |
| **Feature Extraction** | Spatial features | Temporal dependencies |
| **Use Case** | Image classification | Disease progression monitoring |
| **Performance** | High accuracy | Effective for time-series analysis |
| **Training Complexity** | Faster and computationally efficient | Slower due to sequence dependencies |

## ‚úÖ Proposed Model
After evaluation, **CNN** was selected as the primary model due to its **high accuracy** and **efficiency** in plant disease classification.

## üìå Conclusion
Leveraging both **CNN** and **RNN** models provides a **robust approach** for plant disease detection. The CNN effectively **classifies plant health**, while the RNN enhances forecasting capabilities for disease progression. This hybrid approach supports **early intervention** and **sustainable agriculture**, improving overall crop health and productivity.
